## Task: Predict Movie Genre Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### Objective 
Predict the genre of a movie based on its title or other available features (e.g., year, description, or metadata) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

### Preprocessing 
Show how you handled missing data, extracted relevant features, and converted the genre column into a multi-label format.
### Model Training and Evaluation 
Present the evaluation metrics for the SVM model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
#### Model Visualization 
Provide a confusion matrix showing the SVMâ€™s performance in predicting the correct genres.
