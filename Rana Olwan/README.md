## Task: Predicting Data Quality Indicator Using Random Forest
## Objective
Predict the data_quality indicator (0 or 1) based on various economic and cost-of-living features for cities worldwide, utilizing a Random Forest model.

## Preprocessing
### Missing Data Handling: 
Describe the imputation method used for columns with missing values.
### Categorical Encoding: 
Encode the city and country columns, possibly using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
### Feature Scaling: 
Scale the numerical features, particularly the cost factors (x1 through x55), for optimal model performance.##
## Model Training and Evaluation
### Model Training: 
Train a Random Forest model on the dataset, including hyperparameter tuning for maximum depth and the number of estimators.
### Evaluation Metrics: 
Measure model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
## Visualizations
### Feature Importance Plot: 
Visualize feature importance to understand the top contributors to data_quality.
### Confusion Matrix: 
Provide a confusion matrix to visualize model performance.
### ROC Curve: 
Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC score to evaluate the model's predictive capability.
