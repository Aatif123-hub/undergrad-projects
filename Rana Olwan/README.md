# Task: Customer Segmentation Using DBSCAN

## Objective
Perform customer segmentation based on shopping mall data, which includes features like age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The aim is to group customers into segments using DBSCAN, a density-based clustering method.

## Preprocessing
- **Missing Data Handling**: Describe the method used to handle any missing data, whether through imputation or exclusion.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables, such as gender, into numerical values suitable for clustering.
- **Feature Scaling**: Apply feature scaling to ensure uniformity across features, which is critical for distance-based methods like DBSCAN.

## Model Training
- **Parameter Selection**: Choose appropriate values for DBSCAN parameters (eps and min_samples) to identify clusters in the data.
- **Cluster Assignments**: Show the resulting clusters and identify any noise points (outliers) that do not belong to a cluster.

## Cluster Validation
- **Silhouette Score**: Calculate the silhouette score to assess the clustering quality and choose the optimal parameters.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Describe the resulting clusters in terms of customer characteristics (e.g., high-spending, frequent visitors).

## Visualizations
- **Cluster Plot**: Provide a 2D or 3D plot visualizing the clusters based on features like age, income, and spending score, indicating noise points.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Include a plot showing the effect of varying eps on the number of clusters.
