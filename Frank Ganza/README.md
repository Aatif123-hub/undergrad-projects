## Task: Predicting Weather Conditions Using Random Forest Regression
### Objective 
Use the weather dataset to predict future temperatures based on various environmental factors (humidity, wind speed, mean pressure) using a Random Forest Regression model.
### Preprocessing

Show how you handled missing data, formatted the date, and performed the train-test split.
Model Training and Evaluation

Present the Random Forest model's performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².
### Feature Importance

Visualize the feature importance and explain which environmental factors contributed most to predicting temperature.
### Visualizations

Provide a plot comparing the actual and predicted temperatures over time.
