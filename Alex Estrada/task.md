## Task: Predicting Medical Costs Using Random Forest
### Objective: 
Use a Random Forest Regressor model to predict medical costs based on various features like age, BMI, smoking status, and other factors.
### Deliverables
#### Data Preprocessing 
Show how missing data was handled and how categorical variables were encoded.
#### Feature Selection
Highlight which features were selected to predict medical costs.
#### Model Training and Evaluation 
Provide key metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared for the Random Forest model.
#### Feature Importance 
Include a summary of which features were most important in predicting medical costs.
#### Visualizations 
Present a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted medical costs.
