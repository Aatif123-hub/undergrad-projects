## Task: Predicting Income Level Using Gradient Boosting Classifier
### Objective 
Use demographic features such as age, education, and occupation to predict whether an individual's income level is below or above a certain threshold (e.g., $50,000) using a Gradient Boosting Classifier.
### Preprocessing 
Show how you handled missing data and encoded categorical variables for model training.
### Model Training 
Present the Gradient Boosting model with the chosen hyperparameters and include accuracy and performance metrics.
### Evaluation Metrics 
Provide the model's accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
### Feature Importance 
Include insights into which features were most important in predicting income levels, along with a bar plot visualization.
