## Task: Predicting Weather Attributes Using Decision Tree Regression
### Objective 
Use historical weather data to predict temperature based on features like humidity, wind speed, and pressure using a Decision Tree Regression model.
### Preprocessing 
Show how you handled missing data and prepared the dataset.
### Model Training 
Provide the trained Decision Tree Regression model and its performance metrics (MAE, MSE).
### Visualizations 
Include a plot comparing the actual and predicted temperature values.
