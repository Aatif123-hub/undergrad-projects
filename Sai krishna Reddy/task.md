## Task: Predict Mean Temperature Using Multiple Features using Decision Tree Regression
### Objective 
Use Linear Regression or Decision Tree Regression to predict the mean temperature based on features such as humidity, wind speed, and mean pressure.
### Preprocessing 
Demonstrate how you cleaned the dataset and prepared the features.
### Model Training and Evaluation 
Show the evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RÂ²) for the Decision Tree model.
### Visualization 
Provide a plot of actual vs predicted temperatures.
