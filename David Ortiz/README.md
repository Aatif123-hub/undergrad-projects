# Task: Predicting Future Stock Prices Using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Objective 
Use historical stock price data from Apple Inc. (AAPL) to predict future closing prices based on features like open, high, low, volume, etc., using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model.

## Preprocessing 
- **Missing Data Handling**: Explain the steps taken to handle any missing values in the dataset, such as imputation or deletion.
- **Feature Selection**: Describe how you selected relevant features for prediction, such as using feature correlation or feature importance analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert the data into sequences suitable for RNN input, where each sequence represents a time window of stock prices.
- **Feature Scaling**: Apply feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler) to ensure that the data is normalized for the RNN model.

## Model Training and Evaluation 
- **Model Training**: Train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), such as LSTM or GRU, on the dataset. Discuss any architectural choices made, such as the number of layers and units, as well as any hyperparameter tuning performed.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Visualizations 
- **Actual vs. Predicted Plot**: Provide a plot comparing the actual and predicted closing prices over time to visually assess the model's accuracy.
- **Training Loss**: Optionally, include a plot of the training loss over epochs to show the modelâ€™s learning progress.
