## Task: Predicting Diabetes Type Using Random Forest Classifier
### Objective 
Use features such as genetic markers, insulin levels, and others to predict the type of diabetes (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, Gestational) using a Random Forest Classifier.

### Preprocessing 
Explain how you handled missing data and encoded categorical variables for model training.
### Model Training 
Present the Random Forest model along with the hyperparameters you chose (e.g., number of trees).
### Evaluation Metrics 
Provide the model's accuracy and classification report. You can also include a confusion matrix.
### Feature Importance 
Provide insights into which features were most important for predicting diabetes type. Include a bar plot visualization.
