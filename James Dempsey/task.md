# Task: Predict Diabetes Type Using Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Objective 
Predict the type of diabetes (e.g., Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, LADA, Neonatal Diabetes) based on medical and health attributes like Genetic Markers, Autoantibodies, Insulin Levels, BMI, Blood Pressure, etc.

## Preprocessing 
- **Missing Data Handling**: Describe how you handled any missing data, whether by imputation or exclusion.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Explain the encoding techniques used for categorical variables, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Model Training and Evaluation 
- **Model Training**: Train a Gradient Boosting Classifier on the dataset and describe any hyperparameter tuning techniques used, such as Grid Search or Randomized Search.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Report the evaluation metrics for the Gradient Boosting model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Feature Importance 
- **Feature Importance Plot**: Provide a plot showing the most important features contributing to the model's predictions, helping to explain which features are most influential in predicting the type of diabetes.
