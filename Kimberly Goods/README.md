## Task: Predicting Future Exchange Rates Using LSTM
### Objective 
Use historical exchange rate data to predict future exchange rates for major currencies (such as Euro, USD, or Yen) using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
### Preprocessing 
Show how you handled missing data, normalized the dataset, and created sequences for LSTM.
### Model Training and Evaluation 
Present the LSTM model's performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, or RÂ².
### Visualizations 
Provide a plot comparing the actual and predicted exchange rates over time.
