## Task: Predicting Suitable Crops Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Objective 
Develop a model that predicts the most suitable crop based on soil and climate conditions such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The goal is to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the crops accurately, understand the effect of different features on crop suitability, and evaluate model performance metrics.

### Preprocessing 
Show how you handled missing data, normalized the dataset, and performed the train-test split.
### Model Training and Evaluation 
Present the SVR model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
### Visualizations 
Provide a plot comparing the actual crop yields with the predicted values from the SVR model.
