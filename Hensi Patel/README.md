# Task: Customer Segmentation Using Hierarchical Clustering

## Objective
Perform customer segmentation based on shopping mall data, which includes features like age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The aim is to group customers into segments using Hierarchical Clustering.

## Preprocessing
- **Missing Data Handling**: Explain the method used to handle any missing data, whether it's through imputation or exclusion.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Describe how categorical variables, such as gender, were encoded into numerical values suitable for clustering.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize the dataset to ensure that all features are on a similar scale for improved clustering accuracy.

## Cluster Determination
- **Dendrogram**: Plot a dendrogram to visually assess the optimal number of clusters by analyzing where the largest vertical distance is.
- **Linkage Method**: Experiment with different linkage methods (e.g., single, complete, average) and explain your choice for the final model.

## Model Training
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Train a hierarchical clustering model on the data and assign each customer to a cluster.
- **Cluster Assignments**: Present the predicted cluster assignments for each customer.

## Visualizations
- **Cluster Plot**: Provide a 2D or 3D visualization of the clusters based on features like age, income, and spending score.
- **Dendrogram**: Include the dendrogram used to determine the number of clusters for easy reference.
