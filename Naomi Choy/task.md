# Task: Predicting Loan Approval Using XGBoost Classifier

## Objective 
Predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details, including income, loan amount, credit history, and property area, using an XGBoost Classifier.

## Preprocessing 
- **Missing Data Handling**: Describe the steps taken to handle missing data, such as filling in missing values or removing incomplete rows.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Discuss the encoding techniques used to convert categorical features like gender, marital status, and education into numerical format.
- **Feature Scaling**: Explain any feature scaling applied to the numerical features for improved model training.

## Model Training and Evaluation 
- **Model Training**: Train an XGBoost Classifier on the dataset. Include details about hyperparameter tuning methods like Grid Search or Randomized Search.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provide the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluating the model's performance.

## Visualizations 
- **Confusion Matrix**: Show a confusion matrix to evaluate the classification results and identify misclassifications.
- **Feature Importance**: Include a feature importance plot generated by the XGBoost model to highlight the most influential features in predicting loan approval.
