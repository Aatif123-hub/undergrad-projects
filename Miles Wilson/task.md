## Task: Predicting Employee Productivity Change Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### Objective 
Predict the change in an employee's productivity (increase or decrease) using SVM based on factors like stress level, work-life balance, mental health conditions, and other work-related variables.

### Data Preprocessing 
Describe how categorical variables were encoded and missing values handled.
### Feature Selection 
Detail the selection of features contributing to productivity change.
### Model Training and Evaluation 
Provide metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Visualizations 
Use plots like confusion matrix or decision boundaries (for simpler datasets) to visualize model performance.
