## Task: Predicting Suitable Crops Using Decision Tree Classifier

### Objective
Develop a model that predicts the most suitable crop based on soil and climate conditions such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The goal is to use a Decision Tree to classify the crops accurately, understand the effect of different features on crop suitability, and evaluate model performance metrics.


### Preprocessing

Show how you handled missing data, selected features, and converted categorical target variables into numerical values (if applicable).
### Model Training and Evaluation

Present the Decision Tree Classifierâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Feature Importance

Visualize the feature importance and explain which factors contributed the most to predicting crop suitability.
### Visualizations

Provide a visualization of the decision tree and a plot of feature importance.
