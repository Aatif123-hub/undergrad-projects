# Task: Predicting Breast Cancer Patient Status Based on Protein Levels and Clinical Features using Support Vector Machine

## Preprocessing
- **Missing Data Handling**: Describe your method for handling missing values, whether it's imputation or exclusion.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Explain how categorical features were encoded, such as using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Since SVM is sensitive to feature scales, perform feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) on the dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize hyperparameters such as the kernel type, C, and gamma.
- **Performance Metrics**: Report metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for a comprehensive evaluation of the model.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize the confusion matrix to assess the classification performance and identify any misclassification patterns.

## Cross-Validation
- Implement cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) to evaluate the modelâ€™s stability and robustness.

## ROC Curve and AUC Score
- Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC score to visualize the model's performance in terms of true positive and false positive rates.
