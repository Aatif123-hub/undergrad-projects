## Task: Classifying Breast Cancer Stages Using Random Forest Model
### Objective 
Use the breast cancer dataset to predict the Tumor Stage of patients (Stage I, II, III) based on protein expression levels and other patient attributes using a Random Forest Classifier.

### Preprocessing 
Demonstrate how missing data was handled and how categorical variables were encoded.
### Model Training and Evaluation
Show the training process of the Random Forest model.
Provide model accuracy and confusion matrix results.
### Feature Importance Visualization 
Present a plot showing the importance of each feature in predicting tumor stages.
