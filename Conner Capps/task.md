# Task: Customer Segmentation Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Objective
Perform customer segmentation based on shopping mall data, which includes features like age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The aim is to classify customers into predefined segments using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Preprocessing
- **Missing Data Handling**: Describe the method used to handle any missing data, such as imputation or exclusion.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables like gender into numerical values suitable for the KNN algorithm.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize the dataset to ensure that features are on a similar scale, which is critical for distance-based methods like KNN.

## Model Training
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Train a KNN model using customer data and specify the number of neighbors (k) to classify customers.
- **Distance Metric**: Explain the choice of distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) used to compute the nearest neighbors.

## Model Evaluation
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to evaluate the KNN model performance and select the optimal value of k.
- **Performance Metrics**: Report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance in classifying customers into segments.

## Visualizations
- **K-Value Determination**: Plot the accuracy or error rate as a function of k to visualize how different k values affect performance.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Provide a 2D or 3D visualization of the customer segments and their nearest neighbors.
