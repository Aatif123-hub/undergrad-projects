### Task: Predicting COVID-19 Active Cases

## Steps
1. Do exploratory data analysis of the dataset(clean the data, delete the null values, make a histogram/boxplot of the dataset)
   
2. Use features such as total cases, total deaths, total recovered, and population as predictors. The target variable is Active Cases.
   
3. Train the following model: Random Forest Regressor
   
4. Evaluate The models and Evaluate the models using metrics such as:
   	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
