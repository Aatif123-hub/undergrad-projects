## Task: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
### Objective 
Perform customer segmentation based on shopping mall data, which includes features like age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The aim is to group customers into segments using K-Means clustering.
### Preprocessing

Show how you handled missing data, encoded categorical variables, and normalized the dataset.
### Cluster Determination

Provide the Elbow plot used to determine the optimal number of clusters and the reasoning behind the selected K.
### Model Training

Show the results of applying K-Means clustering and the predicted cluster assignments for the customers.
### Visualizations

Provide a visualization of the clusters, including the centroids and customer segmentation, based on features like age, income, and spending score.
