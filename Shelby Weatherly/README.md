# Task: Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes Classifier

## Objective 
Classify the sentiment of tweets related to COVID-19 as either Positive, Neutral, Negative, Extremely Positive, or Extremely Negative using the Naive Bayes model.

## Preprocessing 
- **Data Cleaning**: Describe the steps taken to clean the tweet data, including removal of URLs, special characters, and stop words.
- **Text Vectorization**: Explain the vectorization method used, such as TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer, to convert the text into numerical format.

## Model Training and Evaluation 
- **Model Training**: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier on the processed tweet data. Optionally, perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Report the evaluation metrics for the Naive Bayes model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Visualization 
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provide a confusion matrix plot to show the modelâ€™s performance on the test data and analyze misclassification patterns.
