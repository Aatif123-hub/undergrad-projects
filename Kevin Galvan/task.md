# Task: Predicting Loan Approval Using Logistic Regression

## Objective 
Predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details, including income, loan amount, credit history, and property area, using a Logistic Regression model.

## Preprocessing 
- **Missing Data Handling**: Describe the method used to handle missing values, such as imputation or exclusion.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Explain how categorical variables, such as marital status and property area, were encoded for use in the model.
- **Feature Scaling**: Discuss any feature scaling methods applied to the numerical variables, like income and loan amount, for better model performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation 
- **Model Training**: Train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset and detail any hyperparameter tuning, such as regularization parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Report the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

## Visualizations 
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provide a confusion matrix plot to visualize the model's performance on the test data.
- **ROC Curve**: Include an ROC curve plot and calculate the AUC score to evaluate the model's performance in distinguishing between approved and rejected loans.
