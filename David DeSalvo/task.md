## Task: Predict Diabetes Type Using Random Forest Classifier
### Objective 
Predict the type of diabetes (e.g., Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes, LADA, Neonatal Diabetes) based on medical and health attributes like Genetic Markers, Autoantibodies, Insulin Levels, BMI, Blood Pressure, etc.

### Preprocessing 
Show how you handled missing data and encoded categorical variables.
### Model Training and Evaluation 
Present the evaluation metrics for the Random Forest model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
### Feature Importance 
Provide a plot showing which features are most important for predicting the type of diabetes.
