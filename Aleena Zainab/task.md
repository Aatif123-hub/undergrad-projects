## Task: Predict Future Euro Exchange Rate Using Random Forest Regressor
### Deliverables:
1. EDA and Preprocessing: Show the handling of missing data, feature selection, and creation of lagged variables.
   
2. Model Training and Evaluation: Present the results of training the Random Forest Regressor and provide evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RÂ²).
   
3. Visualization: Plot of actual vs predicted Euro exchange rates.
